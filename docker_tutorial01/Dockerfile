#Base image
# This is the base image that your Dockerfile will build upon.
FROM python:3.12  
#This tells Docker:
#"Start building my image using the official Python version 3.12 image."
# üîç What happens behind the scenes:
# - Docker downloads the python:3.11-slim image from Docker Hub.

#- It uses that as the base to build your own image.

#-  Then your instructions (COPY, RUN, etc.) are added on top of it.

WORKDIR /app 
# This sets the working directory inside the container to /app.


COPY ./app ./app
